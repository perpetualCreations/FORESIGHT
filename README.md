Featuring basic password logins, powered by the Flask-Login project. 

## 3rd-Party Assets
~~FORESIGHT relies on [dreamerslegacy.xyz](https://dreamerslegacy.xyz/) for stylesheets and certain JavaScript functions.~~

Additionally, for web sockets support, FORESIGHT uses jQuery and SocketIO. 
These are also collected from remote sources, [code.jquery.com](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js) and [cdn.socket.io](https://cdn.socket.io/3.1.3/socket.io.min.js). 

For users going off-grid, consider downloading 3rd-party assets from their sources, and editing references to external parties to use those downloaded resources.
